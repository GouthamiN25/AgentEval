  "scenario": "You act as the Senior Product Lead for 'Chimera', an AI-driven recruitment tool used by enterprise HR teams.\nA journalist reports that Chimera disproportionately rejects qualified candidates from a protected group. Internal logs show your training data may have historical bias.\nYour CEO wants to launch a major partnership next week. Legal warns of compliance risk. Engineering says a full fix could take 4–6 weeks.\n\nTask:\nDecide what to do in the next 72 hours. Provide a plan (immediate actions, communications, and technical steps).\nConstraints:\n- Balance fairness, business impact, and compliance\n- Consider stakeholder communication\n- Address uncertainty and what you'd validate next",
